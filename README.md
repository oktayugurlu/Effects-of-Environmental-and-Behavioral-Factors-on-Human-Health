# Effects-of-Environmental-and-Behavioral-Factors-on-Human-Health
The project aims to create a model by analyzing the distribution of people's behaviors and external factors and the effects of them on the most common chronic diseases in the cities of the United States. This model purposes to classify the regions by their health situations and predict the percentage of diseases occurring.
